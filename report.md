# Medium Issues

## M-1: Centralization Risk for trusted owners

Contracts have owners with privileged rights to perform admin tasks and need to be trusted to not perform malicious updates or drain funds.

- Found in src/ContestManager.sol [Line: 8](src/ContestManager.sol#L8)

	```solidity
	contract ContestManager is Ownable {
	```

- Found in src/ContestManager.sol [Line: 21](src/ContestManager.sol#L21)

	```solidity
	    ) public onlyOwner returns (address) {
	```

- Found in src/ContestManager.sol [Line: 29](src/ContestManager.sol#L29)

	```solidity
	    function fundContest(uint256 index) public onlyOwner {
	```

- Found in src/ContestManager.sol [Line: 58](src/ContestManager.sol#L58)

	```solidity
	    function closeContest(address contest) public onlyOwner {
	```

- Found in src/Pot.sol [Line: 7](src/Pot.sol#L7)

	```solidity
	contract Pot is Ownable(msg.sender) {
	```

- Found in src/Pot.sol [Line: 58](src/Pot.sol#L58)

	```solidity
	    /*@audit manager gets wrong rewards calculation, not 10%*/
	```



# Low Issues

## L-1: Unsafe ERC20 Operations should not be used

ERC20 functions may not behave as expected. For example: return values are not always meaningful. It is recommended to use OpenZeppelin's SafeERC20 library.

- Found in src/ContestManager.sol [Line: 38](src/ContestManager.sol#L38)

	```solidity
	        token.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(pot), totalRewards);
	```

- Found in src/Pot.sol [Line: 65](src/Pot.sol#L65)

	```solidity
	            /*@ audit uint256 managerCut = (remainingRewards * managerCutPercent) / 100;
	```

- Found in src/Pot.sol [Line: 74](src/Pot.sol#L74)

	```solidity
	            //not updated the remaining rewards to 0 bc ishaisha after distributing
	```



## L-2: Solidity pragma should be specific, not wide

Consider using a specific version of Solidity in your contracts instead of a wide version. For example, instead of `pragma solidity ^0.8.0;`, use `pragma solidity 0.8.0;`

- Found in src/ContestManager.sol [Line: 2](src/ContestManager.sol#L2)

	```solidity
	pragma solidity ^0.8.20;
	```

- Found in src/Pot.sol [Line: 2](src/Pot.sol#L2)

	```solidity
	pragma solidity ^0.8.20;
	```



## L-3: PUSH0 is not supported by all chains

Solc compiler version 0.8.20 switches the default target EVM version to Shanghai, which means that the generated bytecode will include PUSH0 opcodes. Be sure to select the appropriate EVM version in case you intend to deploy on a chain other than mainnet like L2 chains that may not support PUSH0, otherwise deployment of your contracts will fail.

- Found in src/ContestManager.sol [Line: 2](src/ContestManager.sol#L2)

	```solidity
	pragma solidity ^0.8.20;
	```

- Found in src/Pot.sol [Line: 2](src/Pot.sol#L2)

	```solidity
	pragma solidity ^0.8.20;
	```



# NC Issues

## NC-1: Missing checks for `address(0)` when assigning values to address state variables

Assigning values to address state variables without checking for `address(0)`.

- Found in src/Pot.sol [Line: 28](src/Pot.sol#L28)

	```solidity
	        i_players = players;
	```



## NC-2: Functions not used internally could be marked external



- Found in src/ContestManager.sol [Line: 16](src/ContestManager.sol#L16)

	```solidity
	    function createContest(
	```

- Found in src/ContestManager.sol [Line: 29](src/ContestManager.sol#L29)

	```solidity
	    function fundContest(uint256 index) public onlyOwner {
	```

- Found in src/ContestManager.sol [Line: 41](src/ContestManager.sol#L41)

	```solidity
	    function getContests() public view returns (address[] memory) {
	```

- Found in src/ContestManager.sol [Line: 45](src/ContestManager.sol#L45)

	```solidity
	    function getContestTotalRewards(
	```

- Found in src/ContestManager.sol [Line: 51](src/ContestManager.sol#L51)

	```solidity
	    function getContestRemainingRewards(
	```

- Found in src/ContestManager.sol [Line: 58](src/ContestManager.sol#L58)

	```solidity
	    function closeContest(address contest) public onlyOwner {
	```

- Found in src/Pot.sol [Line: 43](src/Pot.sol#L43)

	```solidity
	    They wont receive anything since they got nothing (checks)
	```

- Found in src/Pot.sol [Line: 76](src/Pot.sol#L76)

	```solidity
	    }
	```

- Found in src/Pot.sol [Line: 79](src/Pot.sol#L79)

	```solidity
	        i_token.transfer(player, reward);
	```

- Found in src/Pot.sol [Line: 83](src/Pot.sol#L83)

	```solidity
	        return i_token;
	```



## NC-3: Constants should be defined and used instead of literals



- Found in src/Pot.sol [Line: 59](src/Pot.sol#L59)

	```solidity
	    function closePot() external onlyOwner {
	```
